# CommerceIQ

Creating server for REST using node and lowdb and lodash-id where we can mock a database using a json file.


# Dependencies Used (2)
used lowdb with lodash-id for the implementation of json store as DB.
and lodash for utility functions.

## Indentified paging could be provided so to improve the latency of API when size of data increases.
## Trying to implement the same for nested structures as well was not able to by the given time.
