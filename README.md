# CommerceIQ

Creating server for REST using node and lowdb and lodash-id where we can mock a database using a json file.


# Dependencies Used (2)
Used lowdb with lodash-id for the implementation of json store as DB.
Lodash for utility functions.

### Indentified paging could be provided so to improve the latency of API when size of data increases.
### Trying to implement the same for nested structures as well was not able to by the given time.
